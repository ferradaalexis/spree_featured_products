Spree Featured Products
=====================

This Spree extension allows you to mark products as featured and display them on frontend.

Installation
------------

Add spree_featured_products to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_featured_products', branch: '3-0-stable'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_featured_products:install
```

Usage
-------
A `featured` boolean field is added to the `Spree::Product` model. Each product can be marked as featured on backend. You can also filter products by this field.

A path to `/featured_products` is also added to see all featured products displayed on frontend.

If you need to retrieve featured products for any customization, a `featured` scope is added to the `Spree::Product` model.

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_featured_products/factories'
```
